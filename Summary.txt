Using a shader:
--------------

The `init_shader.h' file has annotations to the code as to how each step works, but in summary:
 - Read in the shader file source into memory
 - Create the shader, and compile the source
 - Check for errors

Outside of initializing the shaders, they then need to be set up for use:
 - Initialize a `program'
 - Initialize the shaders to be used
 - Attach the compiled shaders to the program
 - Link the program
 - Check for errors
 - Set the program to be used

The way I have my shaders set up, the vertex shader takes in a vec4 containing the location of a point, and passes out a color based on its location. The fragment shader then reads in that color to be used, and uses that color.
